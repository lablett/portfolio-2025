  title: 'Software Engineer',
  description: `I am a full-stack engineer with commercial experience in React, TypeScript, Ruby, Python. I’ve worked across web and mobile, from greenfield feature development to legacy refactors and platform migrations. I care about writing maintainable code, clear communication, and building software that’s a pleasure to use.

  Before tech, I worked in geology and data science. I spent several years at an open-pit copper mine in Zambia, setting up processes from scratch and teaching myself to code macros to automate geological workflows. Later, I completed an MSc in spatial analytics and machine learning, which led to a data science role in the mining industry.  Eventually, I realised I preferred building software to analysing data, so I taught myself web development and moved into full-stack engineering.

  Outside of work, I organise immersive art spaces at volunteer-run events in the UK and Spain, and spend downtime with experimental baking, paper art, sci-fi, and logic puzzles.`,
